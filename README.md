## üìà Key Projects

- **[ETL and REST API with Bitcoin Price](https://github.com/DataJm/coding_challenge_bitcoin)**: Solved a coding challenge that performs an ETL pipeline for Bitcoin price and development of an API using Python.
- **[Single Page with D3.js](https://github.com/DataJm/taquetes)**: Studies about Github Pages and D3.js render capabilities. You can look at the demo here: [Demo](https://datajm.github.io/taquetes/).
- **[Introduction to MLOps with MNIST](https://github.com/DataJm/unam_api_mnist)**: Webinar introduction to MLOps. Participants learned the core concepts about training, evaluating and deployment of a ML model, and how to consume the model with a web page interface. Demo is offline, only src code here.
- **[Geospatial Interpolation in R](https://github.com/DataJm/DataScienceMX_interpolacion)**: Workshop about working with geo-data, SHP files, and doing geographical interpolation in R.
